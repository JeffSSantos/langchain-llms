AI Temperature
Temperature is a parameter in large languages that determines randomness and the creativity of the response.
Its value ranges from 0 to 1, where the closer it is to 0, the response will be more deterministic,
making it likely to receive the same response every time the same prompt is executed.
The closer it is to 1, the response will be highly variable and creative.

OpenAI LLM
OpenAI has various models that can be used and tested on prompts.
Some of them are gpt3, gpt4, text-davinci-002, text-davinci-003, etc.
When an object is started and a model is not declared, the default model used will be text-davinci-003.
